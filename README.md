# Soccer_Team_Form_Analysis

This repository was created to explore the possibility of building a model that quantifies a team's form based on historical match data. The data was collected using API-Football, and consists of fixture statistics from all of Manchester United's Premier League matches since 2018. The hope for this model is that it provides a way to understand trends in individual team performance. If such a model is possible, teams could use it to see where adjustments can be made to improve play. They could also use it to aid them with important decisions, such as managerial changes or lineup choices.
